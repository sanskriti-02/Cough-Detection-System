# Cough Detection System Using Arduino 33 BLE Sense and Edge Impulse Studio

Accurate cough detection can be a valuable tool in various applications, particularly in the context of recent respiratory illnesses. However, existing solutions often require significant computational resources or lack portability. This study addresses this need by presenting a cough detection system designed for real-time audio processing on resource-constrained devices.

We developed a cough detection system utilizing the Arduino 33 BLE Sense and Edge Impulse Studio. The system leverages machine learning to differentiate between coughs and background noises within live audio streams. A dataset comprised of cough and background noise samples was compiled to train a TinyML model specifically optimized for cough sound detection. This model operates efficiently on the Arduino Nano BLE Sense with minimal resource requirements.
